### Break Out is a game consists of several columns and rows of bricks on the top, a ball, and a paddle on the bottom.
### how to play?
The rule is simple: 
* hit the ball with the paddle by moving the padding left and right with either mouse or left/right key.
* The ball will bounce in the opposite direction when it either hits a wall that's not the bottom wall or the paddle on the bottom.
* Player starts out with 3 lives. When the ball hits the bottom without being caught by the paddle, the player loses one life. 
* The game will be over when no life is left. Player wins the game by clearing all the bricks.
### Features:
* The Ball will moves a little bit faster every time after hitting the paddle.
* The score goes up by 200 every time a brick is destroyed by the ball
* After clearing stage, play will go to the next stage with an increase in difficulty
